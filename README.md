# Deep Belief Networks and Deep Neural Networks
Deep Learning II project: DBN-DNN

This project has two goals

First, it aims to implement a Restricted Boltzman Machine and a Deep Belief Network and use them as Generative Models.

Second, it aims to study the classification of handwritten digits using a randomly initialized DNN and another DNN pre-trained using DBN.


## Content

In the project folder, you can find a Jupyter notebook `DL2.ipynb` which is a step by step guide of the implementation. The folder `code` contains the same code organized in python scripts. The resulted plots are saved in `images` and the necessary data are stored in `data`.
