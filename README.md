# Deep Belief Networks and Deep Neural Networks
Deep Learning II project: DBN-DNN

This project has two goals

First, it aims to implement a Restricted Boltzman Machine and Deep Belief Networks and use them as Generative Models on the AlphaDigits dataset.
Second, it aims to study the effect of pre-training a Deep Neural Network using DBN before handling a classification task on the MNIST dataset.


## Content

In the project folder, you can find a Jupyter notebook `DL2.ipynb` which is a step by step guide of the implementation. The folder `code` contains the same code organized in python scripts. The resulted plots are saved in `images` and the necessary data are stored in `data`.
